{"name":"Computervision","tagline":"Computer Vision Projects","body":"# ComputerVision\r\n\r\n\r\nThis repository is focused on computer vision projects.\r\n\r\n##Edge detection\r\nThe first work is an edge detector. The edgedetector.py file contains the code for such work. I have included a folder with images that have been used with the edge detector.\r\n\r\n##Shape detection\r\nThe second work is a shapes detector. shapesdetector.py is the script that detects shapes.\r\n\r\nThe script receives two parameters: the input image and the output image. If the arguments are not given the script displays a window to select the input image.\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n- All the shapes and the background are randomly colored.\r\n- Each shape has its own bounding box. The color of the box is the same of the shape.\r\n- The white lines are the borders of a shape.\r\n- A yellow point indicates the bounding box center.\r\n- A black point indicates the mass center. Note: the yellow points can overwrite the black points.\r\n- The script yields the image space percentage used by each shape and the background.\r\n\r\nThe folder 'Shapesdetection' contains some images in which the script has been used.\r\n\r\n##Line detection\r\nThe third work detects lines in images.\r\nThe folder Linedetection contains some examples.\r\n\r\n##Pedestrian Detection Project\r\n[Pedestrian Detection](https://github.com/VictorRiosM/ComputerVision/PedestrianDetection.pdf).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
